## 18B CS3041 Human-Computer Interaction Portfolio

This page is a showcase for my designs from the Human-Computer Interaction course (CS3041) of Worcester Polytechnic Institute. This course is aimed to help computer scientists see the importance of the other side of engineering: design. We explored 5 different topics of design and deeply studied the user experiences of these different projects. I had a breakthrough understanding of the behavior that computers should encourage or constrain. 

### About Me

My name is Wenjing Ying, and I am a sophomore of Computer Science major. I have had intern experience of paralle programming on supercomputer. I am familiar with Java, C/C++, Fortran and Javascript. 

### Projects of CS3041

In this course, I have created 5 design projects with several groups of four. [Here](https://medium.com/@wjyingcherry/design-manifesto-7871d8381bcd) is a course report of my understanding of the course for your interest. [Design Manifesto](https://medium.com/@wjyingcherry/design-manifesto-7871d8381bcd)

Below are the 5 designs from this course: 
- [Design for Others: learning to get feedback from real users](https://medium.com/@kendog95/design-for-others-df0d936dbd40).

In this project, our group re-designed the [Technocopia website](http://technocopia.org/) for K-12 teachers to book workshops for their classes. The goal of redesigning the page was to target a demographic that would capture the eyes of teachers into motivating them to be apart of the Technocopia makerspace community in Worcester.

- [Design for Understanding: Use different visual methods to communicate data](https://medium.com/@wjyingcherry/designing-for-understanding-f8e06e7a5d62).

In this project, our group chose the [CORGIS Database "Billionaires" dataset](https://think.cs.vt.edu/corgis/json/billionaires/billionaires.html) Which contains the data for worldwide billionaires. Our group presented the data of 2000 billionaires around the world in four direct charts and one interactive presentation tap to show the relationship between wealth and age, region they live, their source of wealth and the how their wealth.

- [Design for Tension: Create something that forces people to reflect](https://medium.com/@wjyingcherry/design-for-tension-eb9e2f65504b).

In this project, we designed a chat bot using FlowXO for the user to think about a topic that is relatively serious. Specifically, we made a bot that can talk to the user that discuss gun control policies. The intentional goal isnâ€™t to solve your problem, but to try and tackle one small component of it.

- [Design for Wellbeing: Design a website that responds to user emotion](https://medium.com/@wjyingcherry/design-for-wellbeing-9b33e33d67e6).

In this project, we designed a webapp with the purpose of making the computer more considerable when it interacts with the users. Out group used the Affectiva libraries and designed a website that responds to user emotion, with the end goal of promoting wellbeing. Specifically, we recommend an ideal meal for the user based on their changes in emotion.

- [Design for Another World: Exploring virtual reality that provides Immersion experience for another world](https://medium.com/@gyang2518/design-documentation-for-another-world-1d903c1efd4e).

In this project, we built a VR farm that has some little interaction with the user. This "Creepy Farm" we created has a lot of creepy factors and it is really exciting to be played with.
