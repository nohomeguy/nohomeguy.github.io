## 18B CS3041 Human-Computer Interaction Portfolio

This page is a showcase for my designs from the Human-Computer Interaction course (CS3041) of Worcester Polytechnic Institute. This course is aimed to help computer scientists see the importance of the other side of engineering: design. We explored 5 different topics of design and deeply studied the user experiences of these different projects. I had a breakthrough understanding of the behavior that computers should encourage or constrain. 

### About Me

My name is Wenjing Ying, and I am a sophomore of Computer Science major. I have had intern experience of paralle programming on supercomputer. I am familiar with Java, C/C++, Fortran and Javascript. 

### Projects of CS3041

In this course, I have created 5 design projects with several groups of four. [Here](https://medium.com/@wjyingcherry/design-manifesto-7871d8381bcd) is a course report of my understanding of the course for your interest. 

Below are the 5 designs from this course: 
- [Design for Others: learning to get feedback from real users](https://medium.com/@kendog95/design-for-others-df0d936dbd40).

In this project, our group re-designed the [Technocopia website](http://technocopia.org/) for K-12 teachers to book workshops for their classes. The goal of redesigning the page was to target a demographic that would capture the eyes of teachers into motivating them to be apart of the Technocopia makerspace community in Worcester.

- [Finding different ways to display visual information in order to influence user understanding](https://medium.com/@wjyingcherry/designing-for-understanding-f8e06e7a5d62).

We worked with the [CORGIS Database "Billionaires" dataset](https://think.cs.vt.edu/corgis/json/billionaires/billionaires.html) to display data about the world's richest individuals through several different lenses. One displayed the data in a straightforward manner, but the other was intended to persuade users into finding a set of "commonalities" between the billionaires.

- [Building a chatbot to navigate the discussion of a tense topic](https://medium.com/@wjyingcherry/design-for-tension-eb9e2f65504b).

We built a chatbot that attempts to convince users to become pro-nuclear energy in their community. Using a series of persuasive facts and logical reasoning, it attempts to address any concerns about nuclear energy that the user might have. If the user already supports nuclear energy, it provides resources to help the user spread the word about its benefits.

- [Designing a webapp that attempt to improve a userâ€™s life by reading their emotions/actions](https://medium.com/@wjyingcherry/design-for-wellbeing-9b33e33d67e6).

We built an app that can detect whether if a user is falling asleep while working at their computer. When they do, the app gently wakes them up and suggests a healthy activity to get them away from the screen for a bit - like taking a nap or getting some water to drink.

- [Creating a VR interface that gives users a new perspective on technology](https://medium.com/@gyang2518/design-documentation-for-another-world-1d903c1efd4e).

We built a VR world that helps users explore poetry. This prototype uses Robert Frost's "Stopping By Woods on a Snowy Evening" as an example: the user is surrounded by images reflecting the content of the poem. Part-by-part, the narrator reads the poem to the user, changing the imagery to best fit the content of the poem.
